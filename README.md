# Student Grade Performance Analysis Dashboard

This dashboard analyzes the relationship between student habits (such as study hours, sleep duration, screen time, and physical activity) and their academic performance (exam scores, GPA, attendance) using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

It aims to uncover insights into which lifestyle factors most strongly influence academic outcomes, helping educators and students make data-driven decisions to improve learning outcomes.
